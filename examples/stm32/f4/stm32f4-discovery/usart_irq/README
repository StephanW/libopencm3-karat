This example program echoes data sent in on USART2 on the
ST STM32F4DISCOVERY eval board. Uses interrupts for that purpose.

Connect your TTL RX device line to PA2 on the discovery board.
Connect your TTL TX device line to PA3 on the discovery board.

The terminal settings for the receiving device/PC are 38400 8n1.

The sending is done in a blocking way in the code.
